Class-Private

This module provides some level of encapsulation around hashrefs for objects. It does this by transforming every C<key> into C<package::key>. This way you won't have collisions. If the key contains C<::>, it will not be transformed, and normal access takes place. Thus keys from other packages can be accessed explicitly if necessary.
